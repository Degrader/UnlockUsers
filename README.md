# UnlockUsers
Tool for helpdesk staff to view locked out user accounts, and unlock them individually or in bulk on each non read-only domain controller.

If you have Active Directory sites and services set up to delay replicaiton to any remote domain controller(s), then you may have run into problems unlocking user accounts for remote workers, only to have them remain locked out on those DC's behind your replication delay. This tool allows helpdesk staff (or anyone with the permissions delegated) to display all locked out users across all domain controllers, and unlock them domain wide in a snap.
